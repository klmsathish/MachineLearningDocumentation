# MachineLearningDocumentation
Documentation of Packages in AI &amp; ML

## Getting Started

Programs build on Python lang. Clone the project and run on your local machine for development and testing purpose. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python compiler 32/64 bit based on your system processesor
Recommended IDE:
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Colab

### Installing
Prerequisite: Python compiler
While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the JupyterLab or the classic Jupyter Notebook.

Installing Jupyter Notebook using Conda
* **conda**<br>
We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The miniconda distribution includes a minimal Python and conda installation.

Then you can install the notebook with:

conda install -c conda-forge notebook
* **pip**<br>
If you use pip, you can install it with:

**pip install notebook<br>**
Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

**jupyter notebook**
